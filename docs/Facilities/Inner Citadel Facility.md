# Inner citadel facility

Located under the [[University]] in the [Scholar District](../Glimbourne/Scholar%20District/index.md)

The inner citadel facility is the first facility found, and also by far the largest. Researchers have only been able to open up the first two floors in almost two hundred years, and nobody knows just how deep it goes.

## Floors

### B1
The first floor has been stripped of pretty much everything, valuable or not, and has been converted into a basement for the university. It's steel and concrete walls offering a save environment for more volatile experiments.

This floor has stairs going up and down. There is a lift which is shut tight, the doors are made of a magic resistant material and are hard enough to resist adamantite tools.

### B2
This floor is illuminated by an ancient version of the same magitech lighting that sheds light on the city of [Glimbourne](../Glimbourne/index.md). It is populated by a handful of cleaning and repair constructs. Whenever the constructs are removed, broken, or otherwise missing the facility itself produces a new construct to replace the one lost. Due to the nature of the constructs this floor is not suitable for experiments, however there is a near endless supply of research material since the facility repairs itself.

Attempts to go further down have failed due to the hardness of the lift doors. Any attempts to break into the lift shaft or through the floor have failed due to them being reinforced by the same unknown material.

This floor has stairs going up. There is a lift which is shut tight, the doors are made of a magic resistant material and are hard enough to resist adamantite tools.
