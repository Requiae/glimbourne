# Inner citadel facility

Located under the [[University]] in the [Scholar District](../Glimbourne/Scholar%20District/index.md)

The inner citadel facility is the first facility found, and also by far the largest. Researchers have only been able to open up the first two floors in almost two hundred years, and nobody knows just how deep it goes.

## Floors

### B1 - Labs
The first floor has been stripped of pretty much everything, valuable or not, and has been converted into a basement for the university. It's steel and concrete walls offering a save environment for more volatile experiments.

This floor has stairs going up and down. There is a lift which is shut tight, the doors are made of a magic resistant material and are hard enough to resist adamantite tools.

### B2 - 
This floor is illuminated by an ancient version of the same magitech lighting that sheds light on the city of [Glimbourne](../Glimbourne/index.md). It is populated by a handful of cleaning and repair constructs. Whenever the constructs are removed, broken, or otherwise missing the facility itself produces a new construct to replace the one lost. Due to the nature of the constructs this floor is not suitable for experiments, however there is a near endless supply of research material since the facility repairs itself.

Attempts to go further down had failed due to the hardness of the lift doors. Any attempts to break into the lift shaft or through the floor have failed due to them being reinforced by [[Celenium]].

The lift has recently activated, opening up the main facility.

### B3 - Distorted Hallways
The halls are similar to the previous floor, where the material is mostly the same steel and concrete, however these hallways have been distorted and mangled into a maze, and to make matters worse there are all kinds of plants and moss covering the surfaces.

### B4 - Aetheric Forest
The floor opens up into a large forest with clear skies and a calm breeze. Time flows at approximately half the speed of the outside world. The forest itself is enchanted to disorient and redirect and requires divination magic to navigate. The are markers placed in the forest to find each location.
