# Glimbourne
A city build on the sleeping ruins of an ancient civilisation, both physically and metaphysically. The city has grown and is thriving on the ruins' wealth of magically and technologically advanced materials and instruments. There is a lot to be gained here, but as the Dwarven sages say; "Dig too deep and you might not like what you'll find."

## Introduction
It is the year 1597 AC (After Catastrophe). The world has long restored from the Catastrophe, an event about which we know very little aside from the devastation it caused, even if we go by legends. Researchers think it is likely the Catastrophe was some sort of magical fallout, and that the ancient [facility] the city [Glimbourne] is build on served a vital role in cleaning up the aftermath. A remarkable feat for a ruined people at the end of their grandour.

In the year 1501 the ruins were discovered in the country of Aflea, a year later there was a settlement, and now [Glimbourne] is a thriving city build on research. Many researchers come from all over to grow their knowledge, and in their wake come mercenaries, merchants, craftsmen, and nobles to profit, many of which bring their families along. You are one of the above, whether you were born here or arrived at a later point in life, you have a vested interest in the work done in this city.

Just like the deeper parts of the main [facility], the many small facilities strewn around the rolling hills and forests surrounding [Glimbourne] are all sealed up. Until a month ago that is, when one seemingly opened up by itself. Since then the weather around it has been erratic, and everyone that came close has gone missing. You were scouted to join a small expeditionary force to investigate the disappearances last week, and today is the day that you will head out.
