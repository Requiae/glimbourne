# The Order of Wardens

A lofty name for a rowdy bunch. [Glimbourne](../../Glimbourne/index.md) would not be what it is today were it now for the mercenaries that work to keep the surroundings safe. The Order oversees the mercenaries and is responsible for public safety, which means punishing anyone that steps out of line, and that includes both mercenaries and nobles.
