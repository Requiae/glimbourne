# The Board of Construction

The Board of Construction represents a lot more people than its name suggests. The name stems from the early days of [Glimbourne](../../Glimbourne/index.md) when the [Council](../The%20Council.md) was just established, and most of the production needed was construction. These days the Board oversees all matters of production, and all artisans based in [Glimbourne](../../Glimbourne/index.md) can have their voice heard through the Board.
