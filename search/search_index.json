The world has long restored from the Catastrophe, an event about which we know very little aside from the devastation it caused, even if we go by legends. Researchers think it is likely the Catastrophe was some sort of magical fallout, and that the ancient facility the city Glimbourne is build on served a vital role in cleaning up the aftermath. A remarkable feat for a ruined people at the end of their grandour.</p> <p>In the year 1401 the ruins were discovered in the country of Aflea, a year later there was a settlement, and now Glimbourne is a thriving city build on research. Many researchers come from all over to grow their knowledge, and in their wake come mercenaries, merchants, craftsmen, and nobles to profit, many of which bring their families along. You are one of the above, whether you were born here or arrived at a later point in life, you have a vested interest in the work done in this city.</p> <p>Just like the deeper parts of the main facility, the many small facilities strewn around the rolling hills and forests surrounding Glimbourne are all sealed up. Until a month ago that is, when one seemingly opened up by itself. Since then the weather around it has been erratic, and everyone that came close has gone missing.
